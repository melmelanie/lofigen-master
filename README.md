# LOFIGEN

Lofigen is a [Lofi Hip-Hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo-fi_hip_hop) generator made by Vincent Huynh.
By generating unqiue drum patterns, expressive chord voicings, thoughtful diatonic melodies, and dynamic instrumentations on the fly,
Lofigen is able to weave a soft, warm blanket of sound that is perfect for creating that chill vibe when reading, relaxing, sleeping, or studying.
